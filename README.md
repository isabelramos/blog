### Project Description:

This is a basic 5 article blog page dedicated to the almighty Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Them Crooked Vultures, etc.)

The blog must follow the following criteria:

1. There should be a page header containing the blog's title.
2. There should be a page footer containing the copyright notice. View pretty much any web site to see an example.
3. Each article has a header containing a title.
4. Each article has a footer containing the author and publication date.
5. Each article has at least one section.
6. For each article on your blog page, you need to have the following things to be unique.
⋅⋅- A different background color.
⋅⋅- A different font family.
⋅⋅- A different font size.
⋅⋅- A different font color.
⋅⋅- A different line height.
⋅⋅- A different padding value.
⋅⋅- Each should have a border, but with rounded corners of different size (e.g. one article could have barely rounded borders, but the next one could be almost circular in shape)
